## App Description
- Press start and answer the question before time runs out.

## Requirements

- Have a live timer count down the time
- Multiple Choice questions
- A score to be displayed when time runs out

## Technologies Used

- Jquery for Dom Manipulation
- JavaScript for functionality

## Code Explanation

- I first created a document ready function to hide the questions and score until the user has pressed "Start Quiz".
- Once the user presses the start button, the 1st question appeares along with the timer
- When the timer hits 0, a function runs to disable the selections.
- displayResults runs after the user has gone through all the questions and will display the results on html.
